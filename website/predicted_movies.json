I have always had the opinion that most acting from the 60's and earlier is one dimensional and flat.  But then I saw this film and I realized that I was watching two of the best, from any era.  Fonda and Hepburn are absolutely stunning in here and they so richly deserved to win their Oscars that year.  And not only am I mad to see that Chariots of Fire beat out Raiders of the Lost Ark, but it also beat this film out as best picture, and that is a shame, and a crime.\n\nOn Golden Pond reminded me a little of my relationship with my grandfather. It's not that we didn't get along because we did, but at times it was a little strained simply because of the age difference.  But Billy soon learns that Norman Thayer Jr. is not just an old man, but he is a guy that has a lot say and he can offer him so much and of course they become friends.  So we all know how the movie is going to end up, but it is the execution that is the strength of the film.  We watch as these two grow together.  We sense that they are becoming more at ease with each other and when we finally see our two guys catch that guarantuan fish named Walter, by this time we are pretty much sure what they are going to do.  And it's kind of funny to draw parallels between Walter the fish, and Norman the crusty old man.  But both have been around the pond for years.  Norman's life wouldn't be the same if his quest for the fish was never there.  Perhaps the same with Walter, perhaps he has enjoyed alluding Norman for all these years.  But now the game is up, but it doesn't have to be.  Norman caught him, perhaps that's all that should matter.  You can draw your own conclusions from that analogy.  But I like the way it comes out.\n\nOn Golden Pond is a treasure.  It is sweet, tender and honest.  You will never see a performance better than the one Henry Fonda gives in this one. And this made me want to go out and rent some of the films that the two screen legends were in before and I have to admit that their early work is impressive.  But it is here that they shine like never before.  So my recommendation is this.  If you are young and would never imagine seeing a film like this because it doesn't have someone like Sara Michelle Gellar or Arnold Schwartzenegger in it, then take the take advice of someone who had the same pre-conceived notions when I was 15.  No Sly, no Spielberg?  Hey forget it, not my cup of tea.  But this will give you a new appreciation of film.  It really is that good.\n\nAnd for those of you that have seen it, remember this line? \"Wife's name is Ethel Thayer, thounds like I'm lithsping dothsn't it? \"  What a great film.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H49M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "On Golden Pond: Special Edition", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2694709529", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2JhZTJiMmItNzZhOC00ZmFjLWIyMGYtY2U1N2JiOTI2NTRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2JhZTJiMmItNzZhOC00ZmFjLWIyMGYtY2U1N2JiOTI2NTRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for On Golden Pond", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T15:31:47Z"}, "imdb_id": "0082846", "year": 1981, "youtube": {"name": "On Golden Pond (trailer)", "url": "/watch?v=hmGPkqiwnEI"}, "outline": "The loons are back again on Golden Pond and so are Norman Thayer, a retired professor, and Ethel who have had a summer cottage there since early in their marriage.

If I catch any of the prequels on TV, I will usually leave them in and then sit and watch the end, usually paying more attention to 3 than the previous 2. \n\nAfter watching the much hated on first movie, I found 6 plus points of The Phantom Menace. Liam Neeson as Qui Gon, Duel Of Fates, Darth Maul and his Lightsabre, Natalie Portman gives her best performance in the trilogy, the end battle and even though it ran too long, and he never could have won with all that happened, the Pod Race. \n\nI'm also surprised no other movie has hit on Natalie Portman and Kiera Knightley looking so alike too.\n\nThe negatives are some awful dialogue (OK all Star Wats movies have awful dialogue, but this takes the biscuit!!) \"Are you an angel?\" And in fact anything Anakin says, especially during the final battle are especially bad. It's not Jake Lloyds fault, I think he is fine. It's Lucas who have him the cringe worthy words. Speaking of the final battle.... An alleged experienced pilot like Anakin pressed two buttons (starting his spaceship and activating auto pilot) looking for the trigger to the gun, before he actually grabs the obvious control!! Most of the movie is about federation tax (Yawn) there are some serious plot holes (why is technology more advanced than in the previous three movies, which are set in the future?? What happened to the blockade of the planet?? Why were Qui Gon and Padme still with Anakin when they hear about the sand storm) we don't see the Jedi do anything except destroy droids till the end. Terrance Stamp is woefully underused, and it definitely needs some trimming here and there, do we really need all the repeated reaction shots (like when Padme reveals she is the Queen) and one of the biggest sins for me is, Darth Maul is a real bad ass, and they kill him off in the the first movie (and would he really just stand there and let Obi Wan flip over him, instead of slicing him in half??) What a waste. \n\nI'll state here I don't hate Jar Jar, mainly because both of my kids were fans of his growing up. So my opinion of him has softened over the years. \n\nOh and Jar Jar actually shoots more droids accidentally, than all the stormtroopers added together in the previous 3 movies.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT2H16M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "3D Re-release Version", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2143788569", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMzIxNzI5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzM1NjIyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMzIxNzI5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzM1NjIyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Two Jedi knights uncover a wider conflict when they are sent as emissaries to the blockaded planet Naboo.", "uploadDate": "2011-11-03T08:58:37Z"}, "imdb_id": "0120915", "year": 1999, "youtube": {"name": "Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace - Trailer", "url": "/watch?v=bD7bpG-zDJQ"}, "outline": "The evil Trade Federation, led by Nute Gunray is planning to take over the peaceful world of Naboo.

If you are a fan of Westerns or even when you only like to watch one occasionally, than you should know more than enough. In my opinion Clint Eastwood is the one and only true Hollywood cowboy.\n\nWhen a mysterious preacher - no-one knows where he comes from, what his past is, they don't even know his real name - comes to a gold mining camp near a small town in the mountains, the local miners are in great danger. A ruthless landowner has decided to take their land, he doesn't mind using violence and he has the support of the sheriff. No one seems to be able to stop them. But than the preacher proves to be more than a man of God. He's a good shooter, the sheriff is afraid of him and he's the only one brave enough to rise against the landowner...\n\nIf you are looking for an original movie, than you'll have to look somewhere else. This movie uses all the possible clich\u00e9s that can be found in this kind of Westerns. But on the other hand I must also say that all is done in a very proper way. Eastwood is a fine director and he did what he was best in at the time: he made a Western. The story, the direction, the acting, the scenes,... it all looks professional and more than OK and especially thanks to Eastwood's acting performance in it, this movie is still a 'must-see'. I'm not a big fan of Westerns, but every time that I'm able to see one with Eastwood in it, I'll not let it pass. My advice: if you can see past the fact that it isn't very original, you will almost certainly enjoy it. I certainly did and that's why I give this movie a 7.5/10.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H55M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Pale Rider", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2996764953", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmViMmFmOTAtODA5ZC00MmExLWI5ZTEtOTQ5Njg2MzQ3OGIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmViMmFmOTAtODA5ZC00MmExLWI5ZTEtOTQ5Njg2MzQ3OGIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer 1", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T15:36:36Z"}, "imdb_id": "0089767", "year": 1985, "youtube": {"name": "Pale Rider trailer", "url": "/watch?v=ePlyWlhobDU"}, "outline": "A gold mining camp in the California foothills is besieged by a neighboring landowner intent on stealing their claims.

While some things are added for a laugh, such as Ninevites slapping people with fish (showing the movie's Monty Python influence), some things were made so that it was more accurate. For examples, Jonah didn't want to go to Ninevah, he did decide to go to Tarshish instead, he did stay in the whale for three days and nights, and the vine episode at the end really involved a worm eating it away (although this worm is Khalil, the half catapillar hooked on motivational tapes.)\n\nThis VeggieTale is funny for family, but some may find it a bit dull compared to the thirty-minute ones of before. Still, it's worth the eight dollars.\n\nP.S. If you get bored with the kiddie humor throughout, there's something more for the parents at the end: The Credits Song.

I've just returned home from seeing it at the Edinburgh film festival and can honestly say this is one of the best movies i've seen this year. I could just list all of the best bits of the movie in this review, but i'd rather you all just went to see it for yourselves.\n\nAs a parody/homage of the blaxploitation movies of the 70's, this is perfect. If I didn't know better, i'd think this was actually made in the 70's. Its full of cool little details, the decor, the fashion, the hair styles, the Isaac Hayes/Curtis mayfield style music that details the plot in the lyrics (sometimes scene specific), the grainy picture and the intentionally dodgy camera-work, crash zooms, boom mics in shot etc. During the fight scenes, Michael jai white's kung fu yell is a spot on impersonation of Jim Kelly's (he of Enter the Dragon fame).\n\nLike all the best spoofs, all the actors play it completely straight. White is perfectly cast as Black Dynamite, and if there is any justice in the world, this movie will make him a star. I can almost imagine Samuel L playing this part, but I doubt he could have played it as well as white did. The scene that crystallised his performance for me, was when, during a long speech, a boom mic pops in to shot right next to his face. During the scene, the cameraman is continually trying to adjust the shot to hide the mic. Dynamite continues with his speech as if nothing is going on, but just before he is finished talking, he quickly glances at it, then finishes his speech. The way he plays it is perfect and had everyone in the cinema in fits of laughter.\n\nI said earlier that this is the best spoof since airplane, but I actually think this may be better. In airplane, the jokes were quickfire, but hit and miss, but in black dynamite, every joke hits its mark, and its just as quickfire as airplane. The tone is set pretty quick ( when an undercover agent is caught out cos he cant talk jive properly) and doesn't let up until the credits have rolled. I was still laughing hours after I left the cinema just thinking about it. \n\nWatching this made me wonder how the Austin powers films were such big hits. They were a similar kind of parody but nowhere near as funny, and at the end of the day, aside from a couple of amusing cameos, a one man show (and not a very good one at that). If this doesn't at least do Austin powers numbers, I will be very disappointed, as it deserves the success. Very rarely does a film make me laugh so hard I cry, and this movie did it several times, and its not just me, I think everyone in the cinema had the same experience.

On one hand it seems to be set in the gritty poverty of India, with descriptions of some very unpleasant scenes but then, on the other hand it was described as being uplifting and the feel-good movie of the year. I was curious how this conflicting information resolves itself within one film without off-balancing it.\n\nThe overall sweep of the film is very much a rag-to-riches story with love being the real heart of the film even if \"money\" (or a game-show for money) is the narrative driver and essentially it is modern day fairytale. In this regard it is an excellent film because you are engaged throughout, are totally on the side of the main characters and ultimately the viewer would give anything if they could only end the film happily. In this way it is uplifting and (ultimately) a really cheering film that is worth seeing with an audience because it is one of those things that unites an audience with a common feeling of cheer and goodwill. The method of delivery really helps the plot work because it is colourful, frantic and stylish.\n\nI really enjoyed the fragmented time structure that uses the re-watching of the Millionaire questions in the police station as a trigger for flashbacks. This means we are gripped by several threads/times rather than it being a straight flow. It is not an amazingly unique device but the manner of it being put together prevents it ever being clumsy or obvious by how it transitions from one time to the other. Speaking of delivery and style, the film is understandably an Oscar contender generally thanks to its upbeat nature (after darker material last year and the current downturn in the world, Oscar probably will look for some feel-good stuff) but the areas I think it stands a great chance are those of cinematography, editing and direction. I say this because visually the film is a treat. It captures the colour of India with great camera work that puts us right in the scene. An example is the early chase through the slum, with a frantic camera, plenty of colour (in terms of palate, places and people) and a great visual style with the sun hitting the camera from above as it moves and other effective devices. With this much movement in the camera throughout the film, the editing is key in making these scenes work and it is excellent throughout \u0096 even putting the subtitles in a stylish and arresting fashion which helped sell the use of Hindi but does also match the style of the film more than standard text would have. As director Boyle delivers on all this and his use of music is great as well. It does feel like we have the grit and style of City of God but yet also the warm uplifting story of the very best the \"underdog\" genre can provide.\n\nThat it achieves this is a testament to how well the film is delivered because it does have to overcome the fact that the majority of the film presents us with a terrible world of poverty and suffering and then gradually pulls the main characters out of it. This is a problem that the delivery covers but ultimately the viewer is left with some fairly harrowing realities that haven't gone away by the end of the film. I totally understand those who love the film unquestioningly but I do agree with those that take pause on this issue and note that it is an aspect of the film that really doesn't stand up in the cold light of day. You see, it is gritty and it is unpleasant and, although not based on a true story, this is a reality in our world and to see so much of it in a film that ultimately leaves you feeling good about life and happy that everything worked out alright is not a mix that sat particularly well with me. It isn't helped by the dance number over the end credits, which involved lots of people and pushed the \"isn't everything great\" idea more than the proper conclusion of the story did. I didn't like this part of the credits for this reason and also it would have been nice to see a film based in India that didn't feel it had to \"do\" Bollywood.\n\nThe cast mostly play to the \"fairytale\" side of the film more than the grit, although the young children are very impressive in the first sections of the story. Patel took a minute to grow on me but, although not the most charismatic of performers, he is really steady as the underdog who is driven. Kapoor is a great villain, driven by a hate that says a lot about the class system in place. Pinto is stunning and has a much stronger presence than Patel. Khan works the investigation scenes well, which was important as these are where the story is told from. There are no real weak links in the performances \u0096 the fairy-tale nature of the tale means everyone has to focus on that side of it but they are still good.\n\nThe film is not as perfect as you will hear but it is still very good at what it does. It is a wonderfully stylish and slick romantic fairytale that is cheering and uplifting but of course this does give the slight problem that it is a stylish, slick and uplifting film that features horribly real images of cruelty and poverty. It doesn't manage to reconcile this but it is strong enough to make you ignore this for the vast majority of the time, leaving you tense, hopeful and weepy."}, "duration": "PT2H", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Slumdog Millionaire", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2220163097", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3MjQzNzU2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTEzOTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3MjQzNzU2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTEzOTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The story of how impoverished Indian teen Jamal Malik became a contestant on the Hindi version of \"Who Wants to be A Millionaire?\" -- an endeavor made in  an effort to prove his love for his friend Latika, who is an ardent fan of the show.", "uploadDate": "2008-11-04T12:56:19Z"}, "imdb_id": "1010048", "year": 2008, "youtube": {"name": "SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE - Trailer", "url": "/watch?v=AIzbwV7on6Q"}, "outline": "The story of Jamal Malik, an 18 year-old orphan from the slums of Mumbai, who is about to experience the biggest day of his life.

This story is very loosely based on Janis Joplin and it takes place (Supposedly) in 1969. Midler is a famous rock n' roll diva Mary Rose Foster and she's known just as \"Rose\". She's burnt out and lonely but is kept working by her gruff manager/promoter Rudge Campbell (Alan Bates) who supplies her with shots of adrenalin to keep her going. Rose is an alcoholic and a former drug user and she has a tough past from growing up in Florida. This past haunts her and she keeps talking about showing everyone from there how she has made it. After a country singing star named Billy Ray (Harry Dean Stanton) orders her to never sing one of his songs again and ridicules her morals Rose is furious. She takes off with a limo driver named Huston Dyer (Frederic Forrest) and starts a romance with him. Rudge thinks Huston is just another hanger on but Rose thinks she has finally met her true love. Huston tells her that he's actually AWOL from the army and she tells him of her past in Florida. They have a rocky relationship and Rose meets an Army PFC named Mal (David Keith) who tags along on the tour. This film is directed by Mark Rydell who went on to direct \"On Golden Pond\" and one thing he has shown in both films is complete trust in his actors. There is very little structure to this film and its mainly just a showcase for Midler. Without her dynamite performance this would have been one of the biggest duds in history. Give Rydell credit for a good eye in giving Midler the opportunity. The film consists of two types of scenes. The concert footage that shows Midler's tremendous voice and stage presence, and the scenes where she's on the verge of a nervous breakdown and the inability to exist in the real world. Its very rare to see an unknown explode on screen like this. Midler is nothing short of riveting and astonishing. Her character is so dark and bleak that an actress of lesser strength would have gave out but Midler has so much energy that she appears tireless. The films cinematographer is the great Vilmos Zsigmond and over 90% of the scenes are either at night or in low lit rooms. This gives the film the dark and bleak look that epitomizes Rose's personality and future. Forrest as Huston is also excellent. Aside from \"Apocalypse Now\" this was his finest performance and the two of them have real chemistry on screen. Forrest spent most of his career playing hardnoses or heavies but here he plays a real normal guy who is at odds with himself and if he should remain with the always drunken Rose. The film does go way too long and some of the scenes are pointless. It seemed irrelevant when a former lesbian lover pops up out of nowhere and Rose and Huston have a big fight. This part of the film could have been edited out completely as it serves no purpose. Ponderous handling of the material by Rydell but with Midler's gut wrenching performance it becomes a film that is ultimately unforgettable.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H5M", "imdb_id": "0079826", "year": 1979, "youtube": {"name": "The Rose Trailer", "url": "/watch?v=Eq25dUr8M6E"}, "outline": "Bette Midler plays The Rose, a female rock star strikingly similar to Janis Joplin.

I can list some reasons why I liked this movie so much.\n\n1. Matthew Broderick brings such joy to us playing Ferries Bueller, a character no one would hate. Ferris NEVER gets caught, is an expert at fooling his parents, everybody likes him, and nobody can avoid his favor and all. I want to be just like him!\n\n2. Cameron, a geek friend of Ferris, is someone that portrays everybody's weakness. He is afraid of his parents, negative, and also very sensitive of his father's favorite car. This actor who plays Cameron was very, very good.\n\n3. The principal who tries to prove that Ferris is not innocent and also kind of jealous of Ferris, is the most hilarious character in this movie. He sorta reminds me of my principal at High School.\n\n4. Jennifer Grey plays Ferris's annoyed sister. She was great, and her bad attitude was somewhat hilarious.\n\n5. Charlie Sheen's cameo of a guy in police station was absolutely funny.\n\n6. This is John Hugh's BEST flick ever. \n\n7. Mia Sara was sweet, she played Ferris's pretty girlfriend.\n\n8. The most memorable scene was \"Twist and Shout\" scene, where all people dance in this song with Ferris lip-synching.\n\n9. Cameron's speechless and hopeless stare was excellent.\n\n10. After watching this movie, I am planning to take a Day-Off of my own!\n\nOverall, I give A+ for being the best teenage movie.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H43M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2005514777", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWFlMDZlY2EtNWUyMi00ODY0LWIxZDktY2FmYTg1NzgzYWUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWFlMDZlY2EtNWUyMi00ODY0LWIxZDktY2FmYTg1NzgzYWUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2018-10-29T18:45:38Z"}, "imdb_id": "0091042", "year": 1986, "youtube": {"name": "Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986) Official Trailer - Matthew Broderick Movie", "url": "/watch?v=D6gABQFR94U"}, "outline": "High school student Ferris Bueller wants a day off from school and he's developed an incredibly sophisticated plan to pull it off.

So do not try to analyze it, or figure out what is wrong with the picture. It is a \"b\" movie to be sure, but a somewhat good \"b\" movie as it were. The story has a son trying to fulfill his mother's wish of destroying her life's work at the home she used to live with, she had just woken from a coma. So the son is off along with some science type friends to look into the mystery's surrounding his mother's request. Surprisingly when you write it out it does sound like a good plot and maybe it is not all that bad, but for the most part once they arrive at the house the film becomes your typical horror movie about monsters. Though I do love the setting of the old house and the basement stuff, the movie kind of reminds me of a combination of two Stuart Gordon movies \"Re-animator\" and \"From Beyond\" without being as good as either of them. Still the monsters look pretty good and there are some rather good kills, the plot is rather ignored after a certain point, but with death and mayhem I can live without plot. I would like to see this movie again someday as it has been awhile since I last saw it, but from what I remember not the best movie in the world, but it kept me entertained.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H31M", "imdb_id": "0091343", "year": 1987, "youtube": {"name": "The Kindred (1987) trailer", "url": "/watch?v=yPIKZP5Pdug"}, "outline": "Amanda's deathbed request to her son, John, was for him to destroy all the lab notes etc. from her last experiment.
